# GitHub Notes

To check your own understanding of GitHub, answer the questions that follow.

1. **What is the purpose of GitHub?** 

GitHub is an online version control system that allows users to upload their verson control history for safekeeping outside of a local computer. If the version control hisotry is only stored in git, on a local computer, and that local computer breaks down, the work is lost. By uploading it to GitHub, it can be accessed via other servers. Additionally, GitHub allows users to collaborate on the same repositories through different servers. 
1. **What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?** 

    - **`Forking`** a repository creates a **`remote`** copy of it, so that you can make commits without changing the owner's main branch, and without needing permission from the owner to make commits. 

    - **`Cloning`** a repository adds the *same* repository to your **`local`** computer so that you can make changes to it in VS code.
